# Project 93 - Dynamic Time Table

Optimized FormScreen.
<p>Completed TimeTable.js. Created grid and added functionality to display classes at appropriate times.
<p>Completed ClassDetailsScreen.js such that if a class is clicked, it redirects to ClassDetailsScreen.js and displays all details of the class (including duration) and added functionality to mark class as attended or cancelled.
<p>Wrote NotificationsScreen.js to send notifications for each class. Recquires manual prompt to send notification and does not display sent notifications in a list as of yet.
